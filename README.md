# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.

So its me Bugboy aka BB.
BugBoy’s mind runs on algorithms, his heart beats in musical rhythms. Lines of code and guitar strings are where he finds his flow. Every bug he fixes is a new chord he plays in the song of progress.
BugBoy’s life is a mix of syntax and strums, solving bugs while chasing melodies. With every keystroke, he codes his future; with every chord, he plays his soul. He’s the programmer who rocks, debugging by day, jamming by night.
